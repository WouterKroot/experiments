To implement in the code:
now each trials creates a psydat file, this file should only be created once and saved in it's own folder inside the respective path to the csv file.

Talk to Timo about time, the actual experiment can only be 30 mins long.
null trials = 30 % of time
preparation and eyelink = 15 mins
breaks are in total 10 mins

So if exp = 30, null = 3 mins
prep is 15 mins and break is around 7 mins, we total 55 mins

each staircase condition has a minimum of 50 trials
